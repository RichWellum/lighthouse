# Lighthouse CDC parsing tools

This is a tool to make a comparison between a master file of CDC Labs,
retrieved and combined from: https://www.cdc.gov/clia/LabSearch.html, and a
second search that presumably contained new data.

The purpose is to document new CLIA labs and closed CLIA labs.

For options execute: ./cdc.py -html

The environment needs python3 and pandas modules to be installed.

Output is four files: closed_clia, new_clia, unchanged_clias and
new_master_clia - all in CSV format.
